Dessert Recipes website model.

*This is a small project and practice of HTML + CSS + JS coding, it is of personal use only, to showcase and track my progress as an independent developer.*

- Using JS + CSS, you can interact with the like buttons on the page, the login/logout button and the search bar. The number of likes will change for each time you click on it.
